Here’s a Product Requirements Document (PRD) style outline for turning your simple HTTP server into a polished, resume-worthy “mini web server” project.
This gives you a roadmap that looks professional and helps you talk about it in interviews.


---

1. Project Overview

Name: Mercury Web Server (or any catchy name)
Goal: Build a lightweight, multithreaded HTTP/1.1 web server in C++ from scratch that can serve static files and simple dynamic responses efficiently and securely.
Why: Demonstrates deep understanding of networking, concurrency, and systems programming.


---

2. Objectives

Implement a standards-compliant HTTP/1.1 server from scratch using C++17 (no high-level libraries).

Achieve good performance (thousands of requests/sec) on a laptop.

Provide a clean, documented codebase and test suite.

Package with an installer or Dockerfile for easy running.

Host on GitHub with clear README, architecture diagram, and benchmarks.

3. Core Features

Feature	Description	Priority

Socket listener	Bind and listen on configurable port, IPv4/IPv6	High
Thread pool	Fixed number of worker threads to handle requests (no unbounded threads)	High
HTTP/1.1 GET & HEAD	Serve static files with correct Content-Type & length	High
URL decoding & path sanitization	Prevent directory traversal and injection attacks	High
Config file	YAML/JSON config to specify port, root directory, number of threads	Medium
Keep-alive support	Persistent connections per HTTP/1.1 spec	Medium
Logging	Access log and error log with timestamps	Medium
POST support	Accept form data and echo back or store in a file	Medium
Simple dynamic handler	Register C++ functions for certain routes (e.g., /hello)	Medium
Graceful shutdown	Handle SIGINT and cleanly close sockets/threads	Medium
Unit tests	GoogleTest or Catch2 for request parsing and responses	Medium



---

4. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance: Handle at least 5,000 GET requests per second on a laptop with 4 worker threads.

Security: Resist path traversal, handle large requests safely (max request size configurable).

Portability: Compile and run on macOS and Linux without changes.

Usability: Simple build (single clang++ command or CMake).



---

5. Deliverables

Source Code: C++17 code with headers and source files organized.

Configuration file: Example YAML or JSON.

README: Installation, build, usage, config options, screenshots, performance numbers.

Architecture Diagram: Show request flow (socket accept → worker thread → parser → response).

Benchmarks: Table of req/s with ab (ApacheBench) or wrk.

Unit Tests: At least basic request parsing tests.

Dockerfile: For one-command build/run.



---

6. Architecture Overview

Main thread: Creates listening socket, accepts new connections.

Thread pool: Queue of sockets to be processed.

HTTP parser: Lightweight parser to handle headers and request line.

Router: Maps request paths to either static file or dynamic handler.

Response builder: Assembles headers + body, sends via send_all.


(Include a small diagram in your README showing these components.)

7. Timeline / Milestones

Week	Task

Week 1	Refactor existing code into modules (listener, parser, responder). Add thread pool.
Week 2	Add keep-alive, logging, config file.
Week 3	Implement POST support and dynamic route handlers.
Week 4	Write unit tests, run benchmarks, create README + diagram.
Week 5	Polish repo (Dockerfile, badges), do final performance tuning.



---

8. “Stretch” Features (Optional but impressive)

TLS/HTTPS support with OpenSSL.

HTTP/2 support (just frame parsing, optional).

Static file caching in memory.

Simple metrics endpoint (/metrics) exposing server stats in JSON.



---

9. Success Criteria

Server compiles and runs on macOS/Linux with clang++ -std=c++17.

Handles at least 5,000 GET requests/sec in benchmark.

Passes all unit tests.

Clear documentation and diagram in repo.

Can be run by anyone with one or two commands.

If you implement even 80% of the “Core Features” and present it with a clean README and benchmarks, it will look like a professional systems project.
This is the kind of thing hiring managers love to see because it demonstrates “real” engineering skills rather than just following a tutorial.

Would you like me to also mock up the README structure (with example wording and sections) for your GitHub repo? (That’s usually what makes projects stand out visually.)
